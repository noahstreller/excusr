== Introduction

The Excusr App is a mobile application to which you can turn to, when you can not think of any good excuses. The user can select a category for his excuse and then describe his situation. The user will then receive an excuse for the selected category. To avoid the user using the same excuses repeatedly, the user is given a hint that he has already used them.

== Documentation

This is the documentation for the development of the Excusr™®© App. 

=== Abstract

This React Native Application is a mobile interface using data from https://excuser-three.vercel.app[Excuser Three]. 
The user can use this app to find an excuse if found in a bad situation. 
The user also has to choose a category, eg. "Family" or "Office". 
After the user has chosen the category of their desire, they can interact with the "Get excuse"-Button. Right thereafter, the user will receive a random excuse. 
Excuses, that have been shown before, will be marked with an alert.

=== User Stories

- As a *User*, I would like to get excuses for my desired category, so I can lie to my loved ones.
- As a *User*, I would like to choose a category for my excuses, so i can adapt to the specific situation.
- As a *User*, I would like to have the option to mark duplicates with a warning, so I do not reuse the excuses.
- As a *User*, I would like to have the option to automatically skip duplicates, so I can always see a brand new excuse.
- As a *User*, I would like to view my excuse history, so I do not reuse the excuses.

=== Mockup

=== Technical Implementation

The app uses https://reactnativepaper.com/[React Native Paper] as a component library, to ensure proper MD3 implementation. We use Tab navigation and the Expo Router package to handle the routing.

There are also some custom made components, such as:

- Blockquote
- Category Dropdown
- Excuse Output Field
- Header (based on the Paper component)
- Navigation Bottom Bar (based on the Paper component)
- Banner, which is shown when the excuse is a duplicate
- Popup
- Settings Item
- Toggle Switch

As for persistence, we save the full excuse object as a JSON string. The excuse objects have following attributes:

```ts
{
  id: number;
  excuse: string;
  category: string;
}
```

This string is saved to and retrieved from the Async-Storage, provided by the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` module.

==== Fazit
- The project all in all went quite well. We made good progress and didnt have to stress at all.
- We are quite happy with our result and what we achived in the little time we had.
- We learnt how to navigate some of the troubles with React Native and made some new experiences with working with Figma. My College and I can both say we have been able to gain knowledge from this project.
- We achived all we had wanted and even tho there are some ease of use items we could add but those are more luxuries than necessities.
